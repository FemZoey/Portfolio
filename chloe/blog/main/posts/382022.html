        First of all, thank you to everyone who accepted me as a Vtuber, I'm really grateful to you all,<br>
        specially <a href="https://twitter.com/NyashkoTV">Nyashko</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/puppycatpawz">Shuga</a> & <a href="https://twitter.com/maria_animates">Mari</a>, thank you for giving me advice and putting me out there.<br>
        I had a extremely fun month for the first time in a while due to <b>YOU</b>, all of the scuffed streams, errors, funny model bugs, japanese goblin & more, just added to this experience, and for that I thank you once more my dear viewer.<br>
